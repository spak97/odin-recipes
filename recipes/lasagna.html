  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
    made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
    A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
    but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
    I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Ground meat</b>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
      <li><b>Onion</b>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
      <li><b>Canned tomatoes</b>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
      <li><b>Fresh herbs</b>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
      <li><b>Sugar</b>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
      <li><b>Spices and seasonings</b>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
      <li><b>Noodles</b>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
      <li><b>Cheese</b>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
      <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
